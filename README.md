# USD GoodStart

A clean, organized USD project template for starting new projects, with a focus on **digital twin applications**.

Please note, this is a WIP project and has not been 'hardend' yet. Therfore use with caution! and on your own risk!!


## About OpenUSD and Digital Twins

**OpenUSD** (Universal Scene Description) was originally developed by Pixar Animation Studios as a universal scene description format to be sent to renderers for visual effects and CGI production. However, its powerful composition system, non-destructive workflows, and ability to handle complex 3D data make it an ideal foundation for **digital twin applications**.

This project template adapts OpenUSD's proven VFX industry practices for digital twin use cases, including:
- Building digital twins from existing CAD products
- Integrating with PLM/PDM/ERP systems
- Connecting to Asset Administration Shell (AAS) standards
- Managing industrial and manufacturing digital twins
- Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) applications

While OpenUSD was designed for rendering, its universal scene description capabilities make it perfect for representing real-world assets, systems, and environments in digital twin contexts.

## Quick Start

1. **Assets**: Place your USD assets in `010_ASS_USD/`
2. **Modifications**: Create or edit layers in `020_LYR_USD/` to modify assets
3. **Textures**: Add global textures to `030_TEX/`
4. **Root File**: The `GoodStart_ROOT.usda` file references all layers and serves as the entry point

## Folder Details

Each folder contains its own README with detailed information:

- **[000_SOURCE/](000_SOURCE/README.md)** - Source files and materials
- **[010_ASS_USD/](010_ASS_USD/README.md)** - USD assets and asset organization
- **[020_LYR_USD/](020_LYR_USD/README.md)** - Layer files for modifications
- **[030_TEX/](030_TEX/README.md)** - Global texture files

## Root File

`GoodStart_ROOT.usda` is the master file that:
- References all layer files from `020_LYR_USD/`
- Serves as the entry point for the entire project
- Contains the base scene structure and environment

## DCC Files

DCC (Digital Content Creation) files that work on the USD files are stored in the root directory:

- **Houdini**: `GoodStart.hiplc` (or `.hip` files)
- **Maya**: `.ma` or `.mb` files
- **3ds Max**: `.max` files
- **Other DCC tools**: Place your working files here

These files allow different team members to work on the USD project using their preferred DCC tool. Each DCC file references and modifies the USD files (`GoodStart_ROOT.usda` and assets in `010_ASS_USD/`), but the actual USD files remain the source of truth. Changes are layered on top as opinions within the USD structure.

**Note**: Different team members may use different DCC tools, so you may see multiple DCC file types in the root directory. Each person works with their preferred tool while maintaining the same USD structure. Changes are layered on top as opinions within the USD structure.

## Example Asset Lifecycle

This section illustrates a complete asset lifecycle from source conversion through production deployment:

### Step 1: Source File Preparation

```bash
# Place CAD source files in 000_SOURCE/
# Example: Export STEP file from CAD system
cp /path/to/cad/export/part_assembly.step 000_SOURCE/
```

### Step 2: CAD to USD Conversion

```bash
# Using CAD-to-OpenUSD conversion scripts
# See: https://github.com/nAurava-Technologies/CAD-to-OpenUSD
cd 000_SOURCE/
# Convert STEP to USD
python cad2usd.py part_assembly.step ../010_ASS_USD/part_assembly.usd
```

### Step 3: Asset Validation

```bash
# Validate USD asset (see validation scripts section)
python scripts/validate_asset.py 010_ASS_USD/part_assembly.usd
```

### Step 4: Create Asset Import Layer

```usda
# In 020_LYR_USD/AssetImport_LYR.usda
def Xform "PartAssembly" (
    prepend references = @../010_ASS_USD/part_assembly.usd@
)
{
    # Asset is now referenced in the scene
}
```

### Step 5: Add Modifications via Layers

```usda
# In 020_LYR_USD/Mtl_work_LYR.usda
over "PartAssembly"
{
    over "SubAssembly"
    {
        # Add material overrides, metadata, etc.
        string digitalTwin:assetId = "DT-001"
        string digitalTwin:plmLink = "PLM://system/part/12345"
    }
}
```

### Step 6: Link to Root File

The root file (`GoodStart_ROOT.usda`) automatically includes all layers via `subLayers`:

```usda
subLayers = [
    @./020_LYR_USD/Opinion_xyz_LYR.usda@,
    @./020_LYR_USD/Variant_LYR.usda@,
    @./020_LYR_USD/Mtl_work_LYR.usda@,
    @./020_LYR_USD/AssetImport_LYR.usda@  # Asset imports at bottom
]
```

### Step 7: Production Deployment

```bash
# Validate entire scene
python scripts/validate_scene.py GoodStart_ROOT.usda

# Export for production (if needed)
usdcat GoodStart_ROOT.usda -o production/GoodStart_ROOT.usdc
```

## Workflow

### Digital Twin Workflow

1. **Source Files**: CAD files or other source materials in `000_SOURCE/` or external systems (PLM/PDM/ERP)
2. **Convert to USD**: Convert source files to USD format and place in `010_ASS_USD/`
3. **Add Metadata**: Map CAD metadata to USD metadata and connect to external data sources
4. **Apply Modifications**: Use layers in `020_LYR_USD/` to add digital twin-specific modifications, opinions, and connections
5. **Link to Root**: Ensure all assets and modifications are properly linked in `GoodStart_ROOT.usda`
6. **AAS Integration**: Connect USD assets to Asset Administration Shell (AAS) for digital twin management

### DCC Workflow (Optional)

1. **Import Assets**: Export USD files from DCC tools (Maya, Houdini, Blender, etc.) to `010_ASS_USD/`
2. **Reference Assets**: Use layers in `020_LYR_USD/` to reference and modify assets
3. **Apply Modifications**: Add opinions, variants, and material changes through layers
4. **Link to Root**: Ensure all modifications are properly linked in `GoodStart_ROOT.usda`

## Project Planning and Implementation Strategy

Before diving deep into implementation, establish clear project planning and management processes. This is **critical** for successful digital twin projects.

### Start Small: POC and MVP Approach

**Begin with a small sample project** before scaling to larger implementations:

1. **Proof of Concept (POC)**: Start with a small, focused project to validate:
   - Technical feasibility
   - Workflow concepts
   - Tool integration
   - Team capabilities

2. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Build a minimal but functional version that:
   - Demonstrates core value
   - Tests key workflows
   - Identifies challenges early
   - Provides learning opportunities

3. **Iterative Learning**: Through POC and MVP, necessary learnings will be discovered:
   - **Within teams**: Technical capabilities and workflow preferences
   - **Among stakeholders**: Requirements and expectations
   - **Across organizations**: Integration points and collaboration patterns

**This is NOT a waterfall project** - adopt an **agile, iterative approach**:
- Incremental development
- Regular feedback loops
- Continuous improvement
- Adapt to discoveries and changing requirements

### Storage and Version Control Planning

**Define rules and workflows BEFORE implementation:**

When storing original files on servers other than Nucleus Server (e.g., NAS, cloud storage, version control systems), establish clear guidelines:

1. **Storage Location Rules**:
   - Define where different file types are stored
   - Document storage hierarchies and naming conventions
   - Establish access permissions and protocols
   - Plan for scalability and growth

2. **Version Control Workflows**:
   - Determine version control strategy for each file type
   - Define branching and merging workflows
   - Establish review and approval processes
   - Document versioning policies

3. **File Organization**:
   - Source files (Photoshop, Substance, etc.) - where stored and how versioned
   - Final textures and assets - Nucleus Server vs. alternative storage
   - CAD source files - integration with PLM/PDM systems
   - USD files - version control approach

4. **Integration Points**:
   - How different storage systems connect
   - Synchronization workflows
   - Backup and recovery procedures
   - Access control and security

**This planning is part of the project planning and project management process** - do this before diving deep into implementation.

### CI/CD and Continuous Improvement

**Apply software development paradigms to production and product development:**

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   - Automated testing and validation of USD files
   - Asset validation pipelines
   - Automated conversion workflows
   - Quality checks and standards enforcement

2. **Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)**:
   - Automated publishing workflows
   - Version management and tagging
   - Deployment to different environments (dev, staging, production)
   - Rollback capabilities

3. **Best Practices from Software Development**:
   - **Version control** - Git-based workflows adapted for 3D assets
   - **Automated testing** - Validation scripts for USD files and assets
   - **Code review** - Asset review and approval processes
   - **Documentation** - Living documentation that evolves with the project
   - **Modular architecture** - Reusable components and assets
   - **Iterative development** - Small, frequent updates rather than big releases

4. **Transfer to Production/Product Development**:
   - These paradigms developed in software development are now being transferred to:
     - **Production development** - Manufacturing and industrial processes
     - **Production planning** - Supply chain and logistics
     - **Product development** - Design and engineering workflows
     - **Product production** - Manufacturing execution

**Key Principle**: Start small, learn fast, iterate continuously, and scale based on validated learnings.

## Synthetic Data & Physical AI Readiness

        # ML Annotation
        string ml:class = "robot_arm"
        string ml:category = "industrial_equipment"
        int ml:instanceId = 1
        
        # Physical Properties for Simulation
        float physics:mass = 15.5
        string physics:material = "steel"
    }
)
{
    # Geometry and hierarchy
}
```

## Best Practices for Digital Twins and CAD Integration

When implementing this workflow with existing CAD systems and building digital twins from existing products, follow these best practices:

### CAD File Conversion Pipeline

When working with CAD files from various sources (JT, CATIA, Rhino, STEP, etc.), you need to define an **export pipeline** or **conversion pipeline** from the CAD file to USD:

1. **Source Files**: CAD files (JT, CATIA, Rhino, etc.) are typically stored within an existing file structure or database, or exported directly from CAD systems
2. **Conversion Path**: You may Consider using STEP files as an intermediate format for stable conversion
3. **USD Export**: Convert to USD format and place in `010_ASS_USD/`

**CAD Conversion Resources:**

- **[CAD-to-OpenUSD Repository](https://github.com/nAurava-Technologies/CAD-to-OpenUSD)** - Open-source conversion scripts from the USD study group:
  - Python-based CAD to USD conversion tools
  - Example workflows for STEP file conversion
  - Foundation for building custom conversion pipelines
  - Uses modern Python tooling (uv for dependency management)
  - Actively maintained by the OpenUSD community

### Connectors vs. Stable Conversion

- **Live Links**: Some connectors exist for live links and coordination with CAD systems. These are useful for real-time collaboration but may not provide stable, long-term connections.
- **Stable Connections**: For production workflows, **convert to USD** rather than relying solely on live connectors. This ensures:
  - Stable file references
  - Version independence
  - Better performance
  - Cross-platform compatibility

### Metadata and Data Integration

When converting CAD files to USD, consider:

1. **Metadata Extraction**: Extract relevant metadata from the source CAD file
2. **Data Source Connections**: Define how to connect USD files to other data sources (databases, APIs, etc.)
3. **USD Metadata**: Write appropriate metadata into the USD file structure
4. **Asset Administration Shell (AAS)**: Connect to **Asset Administration Shell (AAS)**, also known as Verwaltungsschale, for digital twin administration and lifecycle management

#### Metadata Mapping Strategies

**CAD Metadata to USD Schema Mapping:**

USD provides two approaches for storing metadata, each serving different purposes based on NVIDIA guidance and OpenUSD best practices:

**Option 1: Custom Attributes (Recommended for queryable, dynamic data):**

```usda
# Example: Mapping CAD properties to USD custom attributes
over "PartAssembly"
{
    # PLM/PDM System Links
    string digitalTwin:plmId = "PLM-12345"
    string digitalTwin:partNumber = "PART-001"
    string digitalTwin:revision = "Rev-A"
    
    # AAS Integration
    string digitalTwin:aasId = "AAS-001"
    string digitalTwin:aasEndpoint = "https://aas-server.example.com/aas/001"
    
    # Material and Manufacturing
    string digitalTwin:material = "Steel-304"
    string digitalTwin:manufacturer = "Manufacturer-ABC"
    
    # Lifecycle Information
    string digitalTwin:status = "Production"
    string digitalTwin:lastUpdated = "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Characteristics of Custom Attributes:**
- ✅ **Strong typing** (string, int, float, arrays)
- ✅ **Queryable** and accessible via standard USD APIs
- ✅ **Animatable** and can be sampled over time
- ✅ **First-class** in USD authoring tools and workflows
- ✅ **Namespaced** (e.g., `digitalTwin:*`) to avoid collisions
- ✅ **Widely supported** across USD tools and SDKs
- ✅ **Recommended for**: Metadata that must be frequently accessed, queried, or animated (e.g., lifecycle status updates, linked system IDs)

**Option 2: customData Dictionary (For static, descriptive metadata):**

```usda
over "PartAssembly" (
    customData = {
        dictionary digitalTwin = {
            string plmId = "PLM-12345"
            string partNumber = "PART-001"
            string revision = "Rev-A"
            string aasId = "AAS-001"
            string aasEndpoint = "https://aas-server.example.com/aas/001"
            string material = "Steel-304"
            string manufacturer = "Manufacturer-ABC"
            string status = "Production"
            string lastUpdated = "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
        }
        # Additional metadata groups
        dictionary documentation = {
            string source = "CAD System v2.1"
            string author = "Engineering Team"
            string notes = "Initial conversion from STEP file"
        }
    }
)
{
    # Geometry and visual representation
}
```

**Characteristics of customData Dictionary:**
- ✅ **Composable** and non-typed (values typically strings or simple types)
- ✅ **Grouped metadata** under namespace dictionaries (e.g., `digitalTwin`, `documentation`)
- ✅ **Suitable for**: Static, descriptive, archival metadata
- ⚠️ **Less performant** for runtime querying compared to attributes
- ⚠️ **Not animatable** - values cannot be sampled over time
- ✅ **Recommended for**: Metadata about the prim's origin, annotations, documentation, or legacy system info less critical to pipeline logic

**Comparison Table:**

| Feature | Custom Attributes (Option 1) | customData Dictionary (Option 2) |
|---------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Data Type Support** | Typed (string, int, float, arrays) | Untyped/simple types (string, dict, etc.) |
| **Querying & Access** | Easy to query and animate | Requires dictionary key access |
| **Animation & Time Samples** | ✅ Supported | ❌ Not supported |
| **Use Case** | Dynamic, interactive, frequently accessed data | Static, descriptive, prim-level information |
| **Namespacing** | Recommended with prefixes (`digitalTwin:*`) | Key grouping under namespace dictionary |
| **Tool/SDK Support** | Widely supported in USD APIs and viewers | Supported but less performant for queries |
| **Performance** | Optimized for runtime access | Suitable for archival/descriptive data |

**Validation and Testing:**

⚠️ **Important**: Always validate your metadata syntax:

```bash
# Validate USD file syntax
usdview your_file.usda

# Or use validation scripts
python scripts/validate_asset.py your_file.usda
```

**Testing Metadata Access:**

```python
# Python example to verify metadata is accessible
from pxr import Usd

stage = Usd.Stage.Open("your_file.usda")
prim = stage.GetPrimAtPath("/PartAssembly")

# For custom attributes (Option 1) - Recommended for queryable data
plm_id = prim.GetAttribute("digitalTwin:plmId").Get()
status = prim.GetAttribute("digitalTwin:status").Get()

# For customData (Option 2) - For descriptive metadata
custom_data = prim.GetCustomData()
digital_twin_data = custom_data.get("digitalTwin", {})
plm_id = digital_twin_data.get("plmId")
documentation = custom_data.get("documentation", {})
```

**Best Practice Recommendations:**

Based on NVIDIA guidance and OpenUSD best practices:

1. **Use Custom Attributes (Option 1)** when:
   - Metadata must be frequently accessed programmatically
   - Data needs to be queried or potentially animated
   - Examples: lifecycle status updates, linked system IDs, real-time sensor data

2. **Use customData Dictionary (Option 2)** when:
   - Metadata is static and descriptive
   - Data is archival or not actively queried
   - Examples: documentation links, source system info, annotations, legacy metadata

3. **Always namespace** attributes and dictionary keys under project or domain-specific namespaces (e.g., `digitalTwin:*`, `plm:*`, `aas:*`) to avoid collisions

4. **Document your schema** usage clearly in project documentation

5. **Coordinate with AOUSD standards** for wider interoperability

6. **Regularly test** metadata accessibility in your toolchain and scripts

**Non-Geometry Data Handling:**

- **PLM Links**: Store PLM system identifiers and revision information
- **AAS Metadata**: Connect to Asset Administration Shell for digital twin management
- **ERP Integration**: Link to ERP systems for production and logistics data
- **IoT Data**: Connect to sensor data and real-time monitoring systems
- **Documentation**: Link to technical documentation, manuals, and specifications

### Schema Standards and Coordination

**Before creating custom schemas:**

1. **Review Existing Schemas**: Familiarize yourself with schemas defined by the **Alliance for OpenUSD (AOUSD)**
2. **Research Industry Schemas**: Look at what other organizations and projects are using
3. **Coordinate with AOUSD**: If introducing new schemas, **coordinate with the AOUSD group** to ensure they fit into the bigger picture and align with industry standards
4. **Documentation**: Document any custom schemas and their relationship to standard schemas

### Version Control and File Naming

**Best Practices:**

1. **Use Stable Paths**: CAD systems typically have version control embedded in PLM (Product Lifecycle Management), PDM (Product Data Management), or ERP systems. Use **stable file names/paths** as endpoints rather than version numbers in filenames (avoid `version1`, `version2`, `final`, etc.)

2. **System Integration**: Link USD files to PLM/PDM/ERP systems so that the **administration layer is handled by these systems**

3. **Version Control Tools**: If no version control system exists:
   - **Introduce version control** in your USD workflow
   - For design and DCC teams, consider tools like **[Anchorpoint](https://www.anchorpoint.app/)**, a Git-based version control solution designed for artists and creative teams:
     - **Git with binary support**: No repository limits, works with TB-sized projects without slowdowns
     - **Made for artists**: Simple two-button interface, fail-safe operations
     - **File locking**: Prevents team members from overwriting files
     - **Art asset management**: Review, approve, and organize art assets within the tool
     - **Selective checkout**: Work with large repositories by downloading only what you need
     - **DCC integration**: Supports Blender, ZBrush, Photoshop, Substance, and other DCC tools
     - **Game engine support**: Works with Unreal Engine, Unity, and Godot
     - **Python API**: Automate workflows with Python-based actions
     - **Git server compatibility**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, Azure DevOps, Gitea, and others
     - **File sync integration**: Can be used alongside Google Drive, Dropbox, or NAS for non-versioned files
     - Good starting point for version control and file administration for creative teams

### Validation and CI/CD Integration

**Automated Validation:**

Validation scripts are provided in the `scripts/` directory:

- **`scripts/validate_asset.py`**: Validates individual USD assets
  ```bash
  python scripts/validate_asset.py 010_ASS_USD/asset.usd
  ```

- **`scripts/validate_scene.py`**: Validates entire scene (root + all layers)
  ```bash
  python scripts/validate_scene.py GoodStart_ROOT.usda
  ```

**CI/CD Pipeline:**

A GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) is included for automated validation:

- Runs on push to main/develop branches
- Validates USD files automatically
- Checks for syntax errors and missing references
- Can be extended with additional checks (formatting, schema validation, etc.)

**Branching Strategy:**

- **main**: Production-ready assets
- **develop**: Integration branch for testing
- **feature/***: Feature branches for new assets or modifications
- **hotfix/***: Urgent fixes to production

**Asset Review Process:**

1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes and validate locally
3. Push and create pull request
4. CI/CD runs automated validation
5. Code/asset review by team
6. Merge to develop, then to main after testing

### Workflow Integration

1. **CAD Export**: Export from CAD systems (with version control handled by PLM/PDM)
2. **Conversion**: Convert to USD via defined pipeline (possibly through STEP)
3. **Validation**: Run validation scripts to check asset integrity
4. **Metadata Mapping**: Map CAD metadata to USD metadata and connect to external data sources
5. **Layer Management**: Use `020_LYR_USD/` layers to add modifications and opinions
6. **Scene Validation**: Validate entire scene before deployment
7. **AAS Integration**: Connect USD assets to Asset Administration Shell for digital twin management

## Usage Examples and Troubleshooting

### Opening in Omniverse Composer

1. **Launch Omniverse Composer**
2. **Open Root File**: File → Open → Select `GoodStart_ROOT.usda`
3. **Verify Layers**: Check that all layers in `020_LYR_USD/` are loaded correctly
4. **Inspect Assets**: Navigate to assets in `010_ASS_USD/` via the layer stack

### Working with Nucleus Server

**Connecting to Nucleus:**
- Configure Nucleus Server connection in Omniverse Launcher
- Set Nucleus as default stage location (optional)
- Note: Source files (`.psd`, `.sbsar`) should be stored outside Nucleus (see `030_TEX/README.md`)

**Common Issues:**
- **Missing Assets**: Check file paths in layer files - use relative paths when possible
- **Layer Not Loading**: Verify layer is listed in `subLayers` array in root file
- **Texture Not Found**: Check texture paths in material definitions

### DCC Tool Integration

**Houdini:**
```python
# In Houdini, reference USD file
node = hou.node("/obj").createNode("usdimport")
node.parm("filepath1").set("path/to/010_ASS_USD/asset.usd")
```

**Maya:**
- Use USD for Maya plugin
- Import USD via File → Import → Select USD file
- USD files remain referenced, not imported

**Blender:**
- Enable USD import addon
- File → Import → Universal Scene Description (.usd, .usda, .usdc)

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Problem**: USD file won't open
- **Solution**: Validate file with `usdview` or validation scripts
- Check for syntax errors in USDA files
- Verify all referenced files exist

**Problem**: Layers not applying correctly
- **Solution**: Check layer order in `subLayers` array
- Verify layer file syntax
- Ensure asset import layer is at bottom of stack

**Problem**: Missing textures
- **Solution**: Check texture paths (relative vs absolute)
- Verify texture files exist in `030_TEX/` or asset-specific texture folders
- Check color space settings in material definitions

**Problem**: CAD conversion issues
- **Solution**: Use STEP as intermediate format
- Check CAD-to-OpenUSD conversion scripts
- Validate source CAD file integrity

## Notes

- This is a clean starting template - customize as needed for your project
- The `0_` prefix in asset names is used for sorting default assets
- Layers are loaded in order - later layers override earlier ones
- Asset-specific textures can be stored within asset folders, while global textures go in `030_TEX/`
